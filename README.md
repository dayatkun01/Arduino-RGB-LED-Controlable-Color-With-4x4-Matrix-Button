# Arduino RGB LED Controlled by 4x4 Matrix Button

Hi, my name is Rahmat Hidayat. I code for fun and sometimes share my code here so I can reuse it later. Feel free to use or modify this project. If you need help setting it up, follow this tutorial.

## Required Materials
- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- 12 Female wires
- 4 Jumper wires
- 3 Resistors (220Ω–330Ω recommended)
- RGB LED
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad

## Wiring

### Matrix Keypad
- C4 -> D2
- C3 -> D3
- C2 -> D4
- C1 -> D5
- R1 -> D6
- R2 -> D7
- R3 -> D11
- R4 -> D12

### RGB LED
- `-` -> GND
- `R` -> via resistor -> D11
- `G` -> via resistor -> D10
- `B` -> via resistor -> D9

## How to Use
1. Download the code from the `Tags` section.
2. Open it with Arduino IDE.
3. Select your board and port.
4. Upload.
5. Enjoy!
