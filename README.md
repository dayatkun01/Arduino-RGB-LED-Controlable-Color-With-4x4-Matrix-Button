# Arduino-RGB-LED-Controlable-Color-With-4x4-Matrix-Button

Hi my name is Rahmat Hidayat, I coding for fun and sometime i will sharing my code for having fun or for saving its so i can see it or reuse its on future, if you wanna use this, feel free to download and if you dont know how to use or set it up, you can follow these tutorial, i would make a tutorial in every of my github!

Required Materials :
- Arduino (Uno recomended)

Now i will tell you the wirring
(Some step actually are free to place anywhere, buat for easier tutorial, i will tell you must follow so its work as i expected)

In 4x4 module, if the module is same like i tried with this code, you should be able to see C4, C3, C2, C1, R1, R2, R3 & R4.

On every male pin in the 4x4 module, plug female and follow this:
- C4 = D2
- C3 = D3
- C2 = D4
- C1 = D5
- R1 = D6
- R2 = D7
- R3 = D11
- R4 = D12

Then For the RGB, you should see -, R, G, B, Follow these:
- "-" = any ground in you arduino
- R = Breadboard C1
- G = Breadboard C2
- B = Breadboard C3
- 1 Resistor in Breadboard F1 and the other foot in Breadboard E1
- 1 Resistor in Breadboard F2 and the other foot in Breadboard E2
- 1 Resistor in Breadboard F3 and the other foot in Breadboard E3
- 1 Jumper wire from Breadboard J1 and the other in D11
- 1 Jumper wire from Breadboard J2 and the other in D10
- 1 Jumper wire from Breadboard J3 and the other in D9

And with that, you should be all setle, now you just need to download the code from "Tags" tab, and download cpp and upload it into you arduino Thanks for reading this!
